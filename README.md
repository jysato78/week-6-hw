GifTastic

In this app, the GIPHY API was used to to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs relating to desserts. JavaScript and jQuery were used to change the HTML.  When the user clicks on a dessert button, 10 gifs relating to that dessert type get loaded.  If the user clicks on any of the gifs, the image becomes a moving image, and if they click again, the image becomes a still image.  The user can add a new dessert type by typing in the name and clicking on the Add button.  Again, if they click on that dessert button, relevant gifs get loaded.
